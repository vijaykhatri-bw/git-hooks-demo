# git-hooks-demo
This is a demo repository to try git hooks

Steps
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. In the root directory run 'npm run init-git-hooks'.
3. Create a new custom metadata file. i.e. any file with '.md-meta.xml' extension.
4. Try to commit the new created file with any tool such as git cmd, github desktop or source tree. 
5. The commit should fail.

Note: if you are on Windows and the step 2 fails try it with git bash.

Feel free to create new branches and try it out.
